# JasperReport
My first Jasper report using Jaspersoft studio, Springboot, and Java version 17

## Summary
The goal of this project was to understand Jasper report creation, which is essential for generating structured documents in business applications. 
Beginning with Jaspersoft Studio, I designed the report template, defining parameters and configuring table fields. 
Then, a Java project, equipped with Lombok, Spring Web, and Jaspersoft dependencies, was initiated through Spring Initializer. 
The JRXML file, embodying the report's layout and data structure, was integrated into the project, and then mock data was filled into the table. 
Using the JasperReports library, I compiled the report into a PDF file, populating it with actual data. 
Finally, I employed custom Spring Boot code for dynamic PDF report generation, providing the capability to generate precise business reports 
like invoices and sales summaries. [Click here to download the PDF That was generated by this project!](https://github.com/Landycodes/JasperReport/files/12529146/FirstReport.pdf)
